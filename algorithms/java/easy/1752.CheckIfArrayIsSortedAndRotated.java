 * Testcase Example:  '[3,4,5,1,2]'
 *
 * Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in
 * non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including
 * zero). Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * There may be duplicates in the original array.
 * 
 * Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same
 * length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo
 * operation.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
 * You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of
 * value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
 * You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make
 * nums.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
